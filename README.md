# URL shortener
## Project Description
This project is a URL shortener, a tool designed to convert long URLs into more manageable, shortened versions. These short URLs follow the format http://localhost:3000/short/ followed by a unique 5-digit code (e.g., http://localhost:3000/short/2KP91). 

## Features
- URL Shortening: Converts long URLs into short, easily shareable links.
- Easy Copying: Users can quickly copy the shortened URL to the clipboard with a single click.
- Data Storage: Long and short URLs are stored in a data.json file for persistence.
  - The data.json file should be located in the root directory of the project. If it's not present, you should create it manually with the above structure.
